## Description
Purpose of this analysis is to perform a Deep Learning Marketing Mix analysis using retailer transactional data. 
The dataset is from Kaggle and includes transactions, product information and campaign data.  
All information is anonymized

In order to answer the above question we apply ANN Supervised Machine learning algorithms.

## Data
The data include POS sales for more than 1000 products and campaigns/promo mechanics along with product characteristics.
Data are for 2 years. 

## Data pre-processing
In order to better understand the data we apply some descriptive analysis for the continuous variables along with some histograms/frequency tables for the categorial variables. Moreover, we need to recode the categorical variables to binaries with hot-encoding. Also, we split the data to train and test data set. The train set is 80% of the original dataset.

## Machine Learning algorithms
For the purpose of the analysis we have deployed a ANN. We assess the performance with validation data and out-of-sample performance.
